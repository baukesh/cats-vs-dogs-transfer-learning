# cats-vs-dogs-transfer-learning
This is a python notebook for the classification task on Cats vs. Dogs data set from Kaggle. I have produced it for the purpose of learning as a part of the course "CNNs in TensorFlow" from DeepLearning.AI on Coursera. It uses pre-trained model from InceptionV3 in order to show the application of a Transfer Learning technique. This is a modified version of a notebook that was provided on the course.
